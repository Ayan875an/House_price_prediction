# House_price_prediction
üè° House Price Prediction
This project predicts house prices using machine learning regression models. It is inspired by the Kaggle House Prices ‚Äì Advanced Regression Techniques competition.
üìå Project Overview
‚Ä¢	Preprocessed housing data (handling missing values, categorical encoding, scaling).
‚Ä¢	Tried multiple regression models (XGBoost, GradientBoosting, RandomForest, etc.)
‚Ä¢	Compared models using cross-validation scores.
‚Ä¢	Selected the best-performing model for final prediction.
‚Ä¢	Generated predictions for the test dataset in submission format (Id, SalePrice).
Since the Kaggle test set does not provide actual SalePrice, model performance is validated using a train/validation split.

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
1.	Data Preparation
o	Load dataset
o	Handle missing values
o	Encode categorical variables
o	Log-transform target (SalePrice) to reduce skewness
2.	Model Training & Selection
o	Train multiple models
o	Evaluate with cross-validation (RMSE)
o	Choose the model with the best accuracy
3.	Prediction
o	Fit best model on full training set
o	Predict house prices for the test set
o	Reverse log-transform using np.exp() (if log-transform was applied)
o	Save results to sample_submission.csv

üìä Example Prediction Output
Sample Predictions:
[180945.23 202311.55 175600.75 192455.88 210034.67 ...]
If y_test (validation set) exists, you can also see Actual vs Predicted comparisons.

üìå Notes
‚Ä¢	The test set does not contain actual values for SalePrice.
‚Ä¢	Model evaluation is done using cross-validation and validation splits.
‚Ä¢	Final submission (sample_submission.csv) can be uploaded to Kaggle for scoring.

‚ú® Future Improvements
‚Ä¢	Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearch/Optuna
‚Ä¢	Feature engineering (polynomial features, interactions)
‚Ä¢	Ensemble of multiple models for better accuracy
